After missing the birth of his child, his first Father’s Day and spending more than three months away from his family, Mahmoud Khalil has been reunited with his loved ones.
The Palestinian activist arrived in Newark, New Jersey, Saturday afternoon, a day after he was released from a Louisiana ICE detention center. 
He was seen embracing his wife and pushing the stroller of his newborn son after reuniting in a private area of the airport.
“Still, the fight is far from over,” Khalil said while thanking his supporters at a news conference. 
“I continue to advocate for Palestinians, for the immigrants who are left behind in that facility.”
